## Welcome! :wave: :sparkles:

- 🇿🇦  My name is Nadia and I am proudly South African. 
- 🎓  I spent some time in academica and teaching before branching into development after the Great Event of 2020.
- :seedling: I’m focusing on improving my front-end development toolbox.
- ✔️  I started with Python and Java with a pinch of machine learning for good measure.
- :paw_prints:  _P.S. Cats walking on keyboards are the OG hackers._
