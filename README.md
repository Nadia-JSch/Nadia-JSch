## Welcome! :wave: :sparkles:

- 🇿🇦  My name is Nadia and I am proudly South African. 
- 🎓  I spent time in academia and teaching before branching into development in late 2021 - spurred on by the impact of the Great-Global-Event-19.
- :seedling: I’m focused on improving my front-end development skillset (Goal: build a React app).
- ✔️  I started with Python, Java, and a pinch of machine learning algorithms for good measure.
- :paw_prints:  _P.S. Cats walking on keyboards are the OG hackers._
