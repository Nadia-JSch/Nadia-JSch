## Welcome! :wave: :sparkles:

- 💻 I'm proudly South African and work in [DevRel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_relations) as a technical writing intern. 
- :seedling: I'm passionate about developer-focused content and aspire to become a front-end developer.
- ✔️  I started coding with Python, Java, and a pinch of machine learning algorithms for good measure.

:paw_prints:  _P.S. Cats who walk on keyboards are not programmers, but hackers!_
