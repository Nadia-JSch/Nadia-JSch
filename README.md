- ## Welcome! :seedling::sparkles:
- Hi, my name is Nadia! I am a South African master's graduate who is re-skilling after the Great Event of 2020.
- I’m currently learning Python and Java OOPS.
- I’m looking to collaborate on some interesting open-source projects. I will find one soon, I am sure! 
- _P.S. Cats walking on keyboards are the real-deal cyberhackers:paw_prints:._
